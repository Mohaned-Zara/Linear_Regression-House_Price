# House Price Prediction with Linear Regression

This beginner-friendly machine learning project demonstrates how to use Linear Regression to predict house prices based on median income, using the California Housing dataset.

## Features
- Uses a single feature: Median Income
- Visualizes the relationship between income and price
- Trains a linear regression model with scikit-learn
- Evaluates performance using Mean Squared Error

## Dataset
[California Housing Dataset](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.datasets.fetch_california_housing.html)


## Visualizations
